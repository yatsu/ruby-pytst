ruby-pytst
----------

ruby-pytst is a port of pytst to Ruby.
It is a implementation of Ternary Search Trie (TST) and it also supports 
scanning by the Aho-Corasick algorithm.
It is built with SWIG.

This software is distributed under LGPL.

I have successfully built on the following environments.

  (1) Mac OS X 10.4, Ruby 1.8.4 (Fink)
  (2) Fedora Core 5, Ruby 1.8.4

tst_wrap.cxx in this package was generated on (1) with SWIG 1.3.19.

Installation
------------

Generate the Makefile.

  % ruby extconf.rb

Make it.

  % make

Then, install it as root.

  % make install

If you want to generate the Ruby wrapper codes from tst.i by yourself,
execute the following at the beginning.

  % swig -c++ -ruby -Iinclude tst.i

How to Use
----------

There is no documentation at this point, but there is README.html of pytst
in the doc directory.

There are examples in the example directory.
You can run examples like this.

  % ruby example/tokenize.rb

ruby-pytst supports following character sets.

  * ASCII      ($KCODE = 'NONE')
  * EUC-JP     ($KCODE = 'EUC')
  * Shift_JIS  ($KCODE = 'SJIS')
  * UTF-8      ($KCODE = 'UTF8')

You have to specify $KCODE *before* you create a Pytst::TST.

There is a EUC-JP example in the example directory.

  % ruby -Ke example/japanese_euc.rb

The option '-Ke' means $KCODE = 'EUC'.
